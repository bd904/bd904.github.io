    <h1>About Dr. Bhumika Dubay</h1>
    <p>Genomics Scientist | Researcher | Educator</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Dr. Bhumika Dubay is a passionate and experienced plant genomics scientist with over eight years of research spanning population genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and plant-microbe interactions. Currently serving as a Postdoctoral Fellow at UAE University, she contributes to cutting-edge research in plant adaptation and evolution, particularly in arid regions, through genome and epigenome studies of <em>Prosopis</em> species.</p>

    <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
    <p>Bhumika earned her Ph.D. from SISSA/University of Udine in Italy as part of the prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie EpiDiverse Fellowship, where she explored the genomic landscape of <em>Populus nigra</em>. Her Master's in Bioinformatics and Cheminformatics from Shiv Nadar University gave her a solid foundation in computational biology, further enriched by her early biotechnology training during her B.Tech at U.P. Technical University.</p>

    <h2>Global Research Exposure</h2>
    <p>Her journey includes significant research fellowships and collaborations across India, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the UAE. This global exposure has shaped her interdisciplinary approach to plant science, combining field research, wet-lab techniques, and high-throughput data analysis. Her work on transposable elements, epigenetics, and plant-virus interactions continues to push the boundaries of plant evolutionary studies.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy & Impact</h2>
    <p>Dr. Dubay believes in collaborative science, open-access knowledge, and mentoring the next generation of researchers. She actively engages in conference presentations, workshops, and interdisciplinary collaborations, aiming to make plant genomics research both innovative and accessible.</p>
